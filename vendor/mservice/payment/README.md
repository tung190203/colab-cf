# MoMo - Payment Platform

Library package to integrate MoMo E-Wallet as payment method
- Online Payment: Desktop, Mobile website
- Offline payment: POS, Static QR, Dynamic QR
- Mobile Payment: App to App, In MoMo Application  

### Prerequisites
- PHP >= 7.2
- Composer 

For development purposes, we use phpunit/phpunit for testing. 

Please check the composer.json file for detailed information on libraries for development as well as suggested packages

### Installing
Make sure you have the correct PHP version and Composer installed. Then you can add the package from the command line:

``` 
composer require mservice/payment
``` 

Or you can add directly to the `composer.json` file and then run the command `composer update`:
```
require {
    "mservice/payment":"*"
}
```

Please remember to run `composer dump-autoload -o` to make sure the autolaod works properly.

## Usage 

### Setting Up MoMo Environment 
MoMo provides 2 environments for integration: development(```dev```) and production(```prod```). 
The model for environment is located at ```MService\Payment\Shared\SharedModels\Environment```

Example configuration is provided in ```.env.example``` and sample code on how to set up your environment can be found in ```SampleEnvironment.php``` file. Please create your own `.env` file and then copy contents from `.env.example` to that file (or make any necessary changes). Please note that `selectEnvironment()` is just a sample code and NOT part of the actual library.

By default, log is turned off. But you can use `MoMoLogger` by setting the `$loggingOff` property to `false` during environment setup. 

### Integration 
The library provides functions to conduct transactions through the All-In-One (AIO) Payment Gateway (```Mservice\Payment\PayGate```) and all other Payment (```Mservice\Payment\Pay```) options (App-In-App, POS, Dynamic QR Code)

For each payment options, you can choose to either use the provided code in ```Processors``` folder to immediately use MoMo services or extend from the models located in `Models` folder. To have a better sense of how the processors work, we recommend uncommented and run the code in ```PayGate.php``` and ```Pay.php``` 

For `Pay.php`, please ensure that the URI you are calling to is correct for the processes you are trying to run accoring to [MoMo's documentation](https://developers.momo.vn/#/). 

## Running The Tests
Install phpunit/phpunit library to the downloaded project:

From the terminal, with Composer: 
```
composer require-dev "phpunit/phpunit":"^8"
```
Or you can directly add to ```composer.json```, and then update the composer:
```    
"require-dev": {
    "phpunit/phpunit": "^8"
 },
```

In the PhpStorm Preferences window, go to `Languages & Framework / PHP / Test Frameworks` choose `use Composer autoload` to load your local PhpUnit library.   
Do remember to run the `composer dump-autoload -o` command first to ensure proper run of Composer's autoload.
Run the tests with phpunit command. For example, you can run the CaptureMoMoTest.php by using the command: 
```$xslt
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/MService/Payment/AllInOne/Processors/CaptureMoMoTest.php
```
Or ```./vendor/bin/phpunit tests``` to run all available tests
